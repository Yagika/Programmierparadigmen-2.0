/**
 * Todo: Complete all the Classes, in most cases the only thing missing are the Iterators.
 * The implementation is up to you, since my "solution" is for sure not a guideline.
 * Also just look over the implementation of the Interfaces and Classes, if you want to change anything
 * feel free to, but since WildBee is an Interface you will have to change the structure of everything.
 * Todo: the last thing will be the testing of the classes, creating objects and comparing them and using the Iterators.
